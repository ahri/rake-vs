Rake for Visual Studio Solutions/Projects
=========================================
> Lazily build and test your Visual Studio solution using [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/)

- Build only when needed!
- Test only when required!
- Push without breaking the build!


The problem
-----------
Getting started with building solutions with Visual Studio is tedious,
especially if you're having to contend with build servers, multi-platform, etc.

In addition, the default VS test runner is possibly the slowest thing in the
known universe. ReSharper is a lot better but it both costs money, and isn't as
intelligent about running tests as it could be (and has weird caching behaviour
when you change the names of your classes/methods).

The clincher, though, is how unreliable MSBuild is at detecting when it needs to
rebuild artifacts, leading to stale DLLs yielding odd results on occasion -
this unreliability is just terrible and unforgivable.


The solution (get it?!)
-----------------------
For the cost of a dependency on Ruby (which comes bundled with Rake on Windows)
you can have a speedy, cross-platform build system that only builds when
neccessary, only runs tests when needed - but *always* runs when needed.

Not only this, but you also get to tweak the dependencies of your build to the
nth degree with full access to Rake and a complete language to express yourself
in - need to download a random number from an online source and package your
artifacts up into a zip with that filename? Rake's got you covered.

Oh, and you don't need to know any Ruby or Rake stuff to get started; just drag
the Rakefile in, and run `rake`!

rake-vs makes assumptions about how your solution is structured, and guesses
that you probably want all solution files in the same directory tree as the
Rakefile to be built. It also assumes that if you reference a test framework
from an assembly, then you probably want to run the tests in that assembly.

Achieve continuous-feedback by running rake-vs in a window, employing  a
filewatcher to re-execute when changes occur. This is possible due to rake-vs'
laziness; re-execution is cheap because only altered assemblies are built and
tested.


Better solutions
----------------
- Build
  - [Albacore](http://albacorebuild.net/)
    - also based off Rake
    - configuration over convention: may suit you or your use-case better

    If you have a highly bespoke project, this may well be a better option. On
    the other hand it does have dependencies on other libraries, and needs a bit
    of setup to get started, requiring knowledge of Ruby and Rake.

- Test
  - [NCrunch](http://www.ncrunch.net/)
    - Re-run single tests as required through amazing instrumentation-based
      voodoo magic
    - Get feedback inside Visual Studio about line-coverage and test-status

    NCrunch is awesome, but it also has an appropriate pricetag for that
    awesomeness. It's nowhere near as easy to integrate into your
    build-pipeline as rake-vs, either. On the other hand it's genuinely a work
    of art...


Usage
-----
Copy the Rakefile to your solution dir (or above it), install Ruby either via
your package manager or on Windows the
[RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/) works nicely. Then, on the
command-line, execute as follows:

```sh
$ rake -T
rake build    # Build everything, as needed
rake clean    # Remove all assemblies and test notes
rake push     # Push to git after testing
rake test     # Run tests, as needed, this is the default action!

$ rake clean test    # remove binaries and test everything
$ rake clean build   # remove binaries and build everything, but don't test
```

Laziness
--------
These examples pertain to the [sample solution](https://github.com/ahri/rake-vs/tree/sample).

```sh
$ git clean -xfd  # remove everything we haven't committed to source control
$ rake
Downloading nuget...

```

Extra features!
---------------
### Has a task to push to git
And of course it only pushes if your tests are passing. And it only tests what
hasn't already been tested. Awesome.

### Works on Linux and OSX, maybe even BSD!
Through the magic of Mono and XBuild, the Rakefile can build in non-Windows
environments, making it the easiest cross-platform .NET build tool abstraction
in the universe. Guaranteed!

### TeamCity compatible
Right now this is only because XUnit supports TeamCity natively ;)

```sh
$ TEAMCITY_PROJECT_NAME=test rake clean test
rm -f Sample/Sample/bin/Debug/Sample.exe
rm -f Sample/Library/bin/Debug/Library.dll
rm -f Sample/Tests/bin/Debug/Tests.dll.pass
rm -f Sample/Tests/bin/Debug/Tests.dll
